    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to support the PulsoASAP application, focusing on storing contact form submissions and testimonials.  Authorization Independence is achieved by ensuring no `get()` calls are needed in security rules. This is accomplished by not having any hierarchical dependencies that require looking up parent document data to validate child documents.  Since there are no user-specific private documents and the testimonial/contact forms are accessible without authentication, all list operations (QAPs) are inherently secure. Structural Segregation is used by placing ContactFormSubmissions and Testimonials in separate collections to align with their potentially different security requirements in the future, and to improve query performance. The structure also allows for easier management and scaling of these data types. Naming conventions are strictly adhered to, improving readability and maintainability."
